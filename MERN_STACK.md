# MERN STACK

The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

### Definition-
   MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications.  MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.i.e.,
- MongoDB - document database
- Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
- React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
- Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

- MongoDB: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.

- NodeJS: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

- ExpressJS: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.

- ReactJS: A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.

### Work-
The MERN architecture allows you to easily construct a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

- React.js Front End:-The top tier of the MERN stack is React.js, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. React lets you build up complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML.

- Express.js and Node.js Server Tier:-The next level down is the Express.js server-side framework, running inside a Node.js server. Express.js bills itself as a “fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js,” and that is indeed exactly what it is. Express.js has powerful models for URL routing (matching an incoming URL with a server function), and handling HTTP requests and responses.

- MongoDB Database Tier:-If your application stores any data (user profiles, content, comments, uploads, events, etc.), then you’re going to want a database that’s just as easy to work with as Angular, Express, and Node.

### Use Cases-
Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN - though it’s ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces.

A few examples might be:
Workflow management
News aggregation
